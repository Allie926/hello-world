# hello-world

My name is Allie. I'm basically a huge nerd. I love video games like Zelda, Skyrim, Mario, and more.
I mainly play Nintendo games but I also have an Xbox One and a Steam account.
I also like cartoons. Some of my favorites are Avatar: The Last Airbender, Steven Universe, Star vs. the Forces of Evil,
Gravity Falls, and Rick and Morty.
